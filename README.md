# Antisocial X

## About

The üêë**antisocial_x** extension creates a truly neutral browsing experience on X (fka Twitter), 
allowing users to engage with content based solely on its inherent value, without any influence 
from visible engagement metrics, follower counts, or social proof indicators. 

It preserves the ability for users to like and comment on posts, maintaining the core interactive 
features of the platform while removing all potential influences of popularity metrics.

## What Gets Hidden

- Like counts
- Retweet counts
- View counts
- Follower/Following counts
- Analytics
- "Followed by" indicators
- All other numerical social metrics

## What Stays Functional

- Following/For You navigation
- Follow/Unfollow buttons
- Ability to like, retweet, and reply
- All content and media
- Core posting functionality

## Why Not on Chrome Store?

This extension modifies core functionality of Twitter/X, which may conflict with Chrome Web Store policies. Therefore, it's distributed as an open source project for users to install manually.
